## Summary

In a collaboration with 13 other CG students at Penn, we created a web-deployed database and search engine for OpenUSD 3D assets. Throughout the project, I acted in a technical lead position. <br/>My individual accomplishments include implementing a **versioned asset resolver** for our server, helping to design a custom asset structure utilizing **USD composition arcs**, and supporting a built-in **Three.JS web viewer for USD**.
