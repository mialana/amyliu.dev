## Summary

In collaboration with 13 other students in the Computer Graphics department at Penn, I held a technical lead position.

## Motivation

Within practically every game development or animation studio pipeline, there is a need for 3D asset storage and browsing. The experience within such a database is core to the productivity and organization of the studio's artists and engineers alike. Seeing this prominent use case, our team of students at Penn set out to create a 3D asset browser that prioritizes 1. scaleability, 2. modularity, and 3. interdepartmental collaboration.

## Achievements

My individual accomplishments include:

1. Implementing a **versioned asset resolver** for our server
2. Helping to design a custom asset structure utilizing **USD composition arcs**
3. Supporting a built-in frontend **Three.JS web viewer for USD**
