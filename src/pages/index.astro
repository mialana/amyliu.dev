                    Hi, I'm Amy, welcome to my personal portfolio. I'm currently
                    an undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a
                    BSE in Digital Media Design (Computer Graphics) and an MSE
                    in Computer Graphics and Game Technology.
                </p>

                <p>

                        steady on the ground. She builds a staircase of books,
                        all the way to the stars."
